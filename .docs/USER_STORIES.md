# User Stories:

### User Story - 1
> Jon is an intern engineer at Tesla. He needs a tool for data quality control that functions efficiently and minimizes manual work. Since he’s new to engineering and has limited technical skills, the tool should be easy to use.

### User Story - 2
> Srishti is a robotics engineer at Torc Robotics She wants a tool to find quality of data she has collected from robot. She wants to find if the point-cloud data she has collected is corrupted or not. She is a robotics engineer and understands how point-cloud looks alike but unable to judge if files are corrupted due to large manual work

### User Story - 3
> Dishita is a student at UW. She wants a easy plug-in/tool which can provide her quality metric reports. She wants a tool which can provide her a detailed report on the sensor data she has collected featuring its quality metrics. She is a newbie into robotics and doesn't understands much of sensor data, hence requires a detailed report to understand the quality metrics of data collected.

### User Story - 4
> Varad is a robotics engineer at Autodesk He needs a tool to know if he can use his dataset is useful for training. He has collected long hours of data from robot and want to know if this data is useful for further training. He has technical background but don't wanna do manual work

### User Story - 5
> Dr. Carter, a Postdoctoral Researcher at a university robotics lab. To publish novel research with reproducible results. He is tired of wasting months training models on public datasets of unknown quality. He wants to confidently state that his own collected data is high-quality. Ben is an expert in his research domain (e.g., sensor fusion, 3D perception) and proficient with ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and Python.

> Student in lab who uis working on autonmous vehicle project purpose: wanna apply reinforcment learning application need to know quality of data to know robustness a in reinforcement learning we need some bad data so that our agent can recover from the mistakes that will encounter, so this bad data is good that can help to recover but we also need to balance good and bad data so quality analysis of data will really give the idea of robustness and performance of the agent

### User Story - 7
> Dharinesh is a software manager. He looks over tool maintenance and scalability testing. He and his team works on testing tool for large and multi sensor datasets to compare and improve/fix bugs. He is highly technical and knows how to perform QA testing.
